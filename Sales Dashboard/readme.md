## Project Overview

This project presents two dashboards designed to analyze customer and sales data for the year 2021, with comparative insights from 2020 and 2023. These dashboards provide valuable business intelligence for understanding performance, customer behavior, and profitability trends.

The dashboards were created using data visualization tools with built-in filters to explore the data interactively based on the following dimensions:
- Year (2020, 2021, 2023)
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Region
- State
- City

## Key Insights and Features

### Customer Dashboard
- **Total Customers**: 573 (3.7% decrease vs previous year)
- **Total Orders**: 1,038 (7.1% increase vs previous year)
- **Average Sales per Customer**: $821 (0.9% increase vs previous year)
- **Customer Distribution**:
  - The majority of customers placed only one order.
- **Top 10 Customers by Profit**:
  - Highest individual customer profit: $3,197

### Sales Dashboard
- **Total Sales**: $471K (2.8% decrease vs previous year)
- **Total Profit**: $62K (19.6% increase vs previous year)
- **Total Quantity Sold**: 8K (5.25% increase vs previous year)
- **Sales and Profit by Sub-Category**:
  - High profitability in Phones, Accessories, and Machines
  - Loss observed in Binders and Bookcases
- **Sales and Profit Over Time**:
  - Weekly trends clearly highlight peak and low-performing periods

## Why This Project Stands Out

- Combines customer and sales analysis in a unified format
- Supports time-based and category-based comparisons
- Incorporates detailed filters for regional and categorical analysis
- Focused on real business use cases: retention, profitability, and product performance
- Provides actionable insights at both the customer and product levels
