# Interactive Dashboard Portfolio

Welcome to my dashboard portfolio — a curated collection of interactive visualizations built using tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, **Looker**, and more. Each project here is crafted to solve real-world business problems through data-driven insights.

## What's Inside

Each dashboard folder typically includes:
- Project files (`.pbix`, `.twbx`, `.pdf`, `.png`, etc.)
- Project-specific README with summary, KPIs, and insights
- Screenshots or preview images
- Optional: Detailed PDF report/description
