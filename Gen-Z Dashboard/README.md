# Gen-Z Dashboard (Career Aspirations)

## Project Overview  
The **Gen-Z Career Aspirations Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI project that visualizes insights into Gen-Z's career preferences, workplace expectations, and management goals. The dataset is based on survey responses from Gen-Z participants, focusing on their ideal work environments, commitment levels, team dynamics, and employer preferences.
