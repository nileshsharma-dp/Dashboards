# Production Performance Dashboard – Vapi Plant

## Executive Summary
This Power BI dashboard offers a deep-dive into the **production performance** of the Vapi Plant from **Jan–Dec 2023**. It tracks operational efficiency, batch quality, downtime reasons, and yield performance — all in one interactive visual.

---

## Business Problem
Management needed:
- A single source of truth for production metrics
- To monitor downtime and operator performance
- Quick visibility into batch quality deviations like OOS and OOT
- A way to track production efficiency over time

---

## Approach
- Used a year-long dataset (Jan–Dec 2023)
- Created measures for yield, downtime %, and operator ranking
- Built intuitive visuals: area charts, bar graphs, donut KPIs, slicers
- Filtered by **Plant (Vapi)** and **Time Period** with interactivity

## Insights Unlocked

- Operators 2 & 5 are high performers (based on yield)
- Downtime spikes linked to equipment maintenance & cleaning delays
- ost OOS cases occurred in Q2 — needs root cause analysis
- Avg. batches per order = 4 → supports batch planning decisions
